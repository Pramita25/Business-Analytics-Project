Creating a Power BI dashboard for the stock market can provide valuable insights and help you make informed investment decisions. Here’s how you might structure such a dashboard:

Market Overview: Visualizations showing overall market performance, such as major stock indices (e.g., S&P 500, NASDAQ, Nifty 50) and their trends over time.

Sector Analysis: Charts displaying the performance of different sectors (e.g., technology, healthcare, finance) to identify which sectors are performing well.

Individual Stock Performance: Detailed views of specific stocks, including price trends, volume, and key financial metrics (e.g., P/E ratio, market capitalization).

Economic Indicators: Incorporate relevant economic data that can impact the stock market, such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, and interest rates.

News and Events: A section highlighting recent news and significant events affecting the market or specific stocks.

Investment Portfolio: Tracking the performance of your own investments, including gains/losses, asset allocation, and risk metrics.
